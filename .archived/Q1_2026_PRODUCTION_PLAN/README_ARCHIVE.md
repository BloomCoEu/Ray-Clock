## About This Archive

This directory contains the comprehensive production readiness plan that was created for Ray-Clock's Q1 2026 development cycle (February 11 - March 31, 2026). These documents are preserved for historical reference but should not be considered current project documentation.

## Archived Documents

## Why Archived?

These documents were time-bound planning materials for a specific development phase that has passed. They contained:
- 35 GitHub issues organized across 4 phases
- Target completion date of March 31, 2026
- Specific team recommendations and timelines
- Milestone-based delivery schedule

While the technical content and issue descriptions may still be valuable for reference, the project has evolved beyond this specific plan.
